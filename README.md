# Hummer Landing Page

This is a simple mock fare calculator for the train system surrounding the Philadelphia-metro area. The main highlights of the application are that:
1. It parses JSON data from a local JSON file containing the fare information
2. It uses Hooks to filter through and sort the data
3. A simple, straightforward, styled UI
