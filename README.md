# Hummer Landing Page

This is a simple mock fare calculator for the train system surrounding the Philadelphia-metro area. It's built with the React library for a few reasons, but mainly because it is scalable, responsive and fast and, perhaps most importantly, it is surrounded by a huge (and growing) ecosystem, making the application's potential limitless.
